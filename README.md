# Overview

InsightFlow is an enterprise-inspired customer journey and growth analytics platform designed to help organizations understand how users move through the acquisition funnel—from first interaction to successful conversion.

Using SQL analytics, PostgreSQL, Python, and interactive dashboards, the platform transforms customer events into meaningful business intelligence for marketing, product, and executive teams.

The project simulates a real-world fintech analytics ecosystem using a fictional company, **PaisaOne**, enabling end-to-end analysis of customer acquisition, marketing performance, conversion funnels, and experimentation.
